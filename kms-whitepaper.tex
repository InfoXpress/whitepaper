\begin{abstract}
    \kms~is a global, decentralized Key Management System.
    It provides encryption and cryptographic access controls as a service, performed by a decentralized network,
    with the help of proxy re-encryption~\cite{wiki:pre}.
    Importantly, it doesn't rely on trusting a service provider, unlike centralized encryption-as-a-service solutions.
    \kms~enables sharing of sensitive data for both decentralized and centralized applications,
    providing the infrastructure for applications from healthcare to identity to decentralized content marketplaces.

\section{Introduction}

The \kms~is a blockchain-based encryption and access control management as a service.
It enables secure private data sharing between arbitrary number of participants in public and/or decentralized networks.
Key Management Tokens (KMT) are used to perform key management and access delegation/revokation operations.

(Overview of encryption: symmetric encryption, public key encryption, encryption at rest, TLS).

(Overview of key management systems: what they do, why, KMS as a service - CloudHSM, truevault; self-run: hashicorp).

(Brief statement that we enable KMSaas with combination of blockchain and PRE)

\section{Use cases}
\kms~provides the infrastructure for a variety of applications that require sharing of sensitive data as a basic
functionality, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sharing encrypted files (``Decentralized dropbox'');
    \item End-to-end encrypted group chat;
    \item Decentralized digital rights management (DDRM);
    \item Patient-controlled electronic health records (EHR);
    \item Identity management;
    \item Secret credentials management for scripts and backend applications
\end{itemize}

\section{Security risks}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Split trust;
    \item Node collusion;
    \item Disinsentivising leakage of a re-encryption key.
\end{itemize}
